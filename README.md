Hello!
In this file you will find a detailed description of my portfolio projects.

1. Santa's Helper Crysis:
   It's a console story game, written in c++. Originally created as a final project for a course named "Introduction to programming".
   The story tells you about deadpool replacing a santa and needing you as their elf, to save christmas.
